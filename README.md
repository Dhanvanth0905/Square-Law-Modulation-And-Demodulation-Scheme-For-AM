# Square-Law-Modulation-And-Demodulation-Scheme-For-AM
Our objective is to generate AM waves using square law
modulation and demodulation scheme.
Generation of an AM signal by a square law modulator
and verifying the signal power of a received signal, which has
undergone with amplitude modulation at the transmitter and
mixed with an AWGN of zero mean and 0.2 variance during
transmission.
This code is divided into 4 sub parts:
• Generate message and carrier signal
• Amplitude modulation using carrier square law demodulator
• Noise addition
• Demodulation of the transmitted signal
